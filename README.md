Created to provide services for people looking for eyelash extentions. This website also includes basic information and explanations for each service; avoiding the presumption that the content is intended for a familiar audience. This website was made only for educational purposes. The idea that this website was based upon was my older sister Tasha. Having had her own beauty business for a couple of years now she has built herself up quite a number of both new and returning clients. Her main forms of contact and
advertisment are through Facebook and Instagram. As I feel very passionate about both my future career and progression in coding and programming, and my sisters business growing, I decided this would be the perfect project to put my heart and hard work into.

## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my first project - Tasha Jane.

This project is meant for educational purposes only, to showcase my understanding of the languages and teaching I have learnt so far in the modules.
Within this file, I will break down in steps the making of this project website and the logic and reasonings behind it.

This project website is made up of these sections/pages:

1. Home (includes a brief understanding of the website)
2. Services page
3. Gallery page
4. Contact page

## UX

### **Strategy**

One of the very first things I considered during the planning of this project website was who the audience would be and what they would expect/want.

Tasha Jane's target audience would be:

* Ages 18 and over
* New and regular users of the services
* People interested in the eyelash and eyebrow services provided
* Individuals looking for a brief understanding of the services
* People that have an interest in beauty

What I expect these users would be hoping for:

* Clear, brief information that confirms any basic querys they may have
* Descriptions of each service to help determine the one that's best for them
* Clear, pristine images that give the user an insight to what they are interested in purchasing

The goals from a business perspective are:

* To briefly educate users on the purpose and intention behind each service provided
* To build a bigger base of clients through an additional adertising platform
* To give users a clear and to-the-point indication of the industry and services that are being offered

The goals from a user's perspective are:

* To be able to find information directly related to what's being offered
* Feel comfortable and able to trust the services that are being offered
* Find helpful descriptions of the services to clearly underline the outcome of the services

**Creator Stories**

Firstly, I planned the project around the creators intensions. As the website's purpose is to provide some kind of help and guidence to users, I felt that it was important to go through, in depth, what I thought would be the best experience for my users.

* As a creator, I want to make sure that my website is attractive and intruiging to the human eye, making the user more inclined to remain and explore the website
* As a creator, I intent to make my website easy to use - making sure that the navigation is clear and easy to understand
* As a creator, I want to make my website look interesting but at the same time not have too much going on, for example, carefully picking images that are used and how often I am using them
* As a creator, I want to make the user's feel as though the website was tailored for them and find exactly what they were looking for when they decided to enter into the web link
* As a creator, I intent to make sure that all content is related and that both text and images compliment eachother
* As a creator, I want to make sure that the structure of my text is easy to read and helpful especially if users are looking for specifics

**User Stories**

Secondly, after putting together ideas from a creators point of view, I then considered the most important factor in the project planning - the users, specifically first time users.

* As a first time user, I want to easily be able to find factual information on what the website and specific page is intended for
* As a first time user, I want to know almost instantly that this page was targetted for me, by containing exactly what the search engine was stating
* As a first time user, I want to be able to visually see what is being offered and have an image regarding each service that is being offered
* As a first time user, I want the website to act as a guide and provide confidence on what it is I'm looking for
* As a first time user, I want to feel as though I'm getting through the pages in a paced and orderly manner, but not too paced that it would become boring
* As a first time user, I want to be able to clearly see where my navigations and options are, making me feel more inclined to re-visit where I left off

With this business being one that's been around for a few years already, the website is intended to not only cater for a new audience, but to include current and returning clients. Whether that be people that already use the companys services and wish to give
the new website a visit rather than the already existing advertising platforms, or people that have recieved the same or similar services before and wish to return - from within this company in the past or from another company in the past.

* As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find trusted reviews evident images to confirm why I would be wishing to potentially re-use this service
* As a returning visitor, I want to be able to locate other forms of contact throughout the website, such as social media links which link to even more detail of the work and services being offered

This website will include all of the above points. During the planning of this website and it's content I did some researching. At first thought of my project idea my plan was to create the project around the idea of the services that the company offers and the
pricing around it with beautiful and evident images to back this us. After research and looking at business pages from well known towns and cities - I would find myself looking into the reviews and feedback from the service users. Here I learnt that many of the
negative reviews came from the lack of knowledge of the service they were purchasing. Having seen these inconsistant reviews, I reverted back to the content of some of the pages, and it was here I learnt that unintentionally some presumptions are made within the
beauty and eyelash industry when it comes to the type of people and age range that use these services. The more I would look at some of the websites I realised that many of them were including beautiful images, very attractive services and price lists layouts - but
very little explanation on what happens during these services - after acknowledging this, I made it a top priority to add basic explanations to the services in my website, making sure that people have a clearer understanding on what it is they would be purchasing.

The research also allowed me to see that there is much more than one age group interested in beauty services, which influenced the way that I planned to design my website. I want my website to be easy on the eyes for a user of any age range and not feel forced or
overwhelmed by the design or content of the pages, keeping in mind that some people may feel uncomfortable or nervous at the thought of beauty treatment, whereas others may regularly use the same or similar services and embrace the thought of treatments.
